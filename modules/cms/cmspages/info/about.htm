	<h3>Sandbox</h3>
	<p>The idea is simple. If you want to test something quickly, just get the new sandbox, add files and run code. You can also download your work and use in your projects.</p>
	<p>Don't need to clean after yourself - it will disappear if not used for more than a week (one-off) or a month (owned one). But don't worry - by <b>used</b> we mean opened on PHPfy or as embedded sample on your website.</p>

	<h3>How my code gets executed?</h3>
	<p>Your code is placed on isolated server and accessed via http, then result of the execution is printed to the output pane.</p>
	<p>Every execution creates it's own environment so you should not relay on any files created by your script (but you can send files to the script in a POST request and you can access any file created on the sandbox). We don't block any functions. However there is 30s maximum execution time limit.</p>
	<p>For more details go to the <a href='/cms/cat/help' class='mixedlink' data-target='cmsContent'>help section</a>.</p>

	<h3>Little bit more</h3>
	<p>Having own sandbox means only you can modify code. But you can give edit permission to the other PHPfy users creating a group responsible for maintaining the sandbox. Owned sandbox may be also blocked to the general public so only editors can access it.</p>
	<p>You can create the embeddable version of your code just by picking the files and selecting the main one to be run. We'll give you a piece of JS to add to your page.</p>

	<h3>Create new or clone existing sandbox in seconds</h3>
	<p>If you like to play with the code without changing original sandbox simply press <b>clone</b> and you'll have a full replica in a few seconds time.</p>
	<p>Enyone can clone the sandbox from the sample embedded on your page. The only difference is that only files included in your example will be copied over. That means you can use same sandbox for creating different samples.</p>

	<h3>Leave your comments</h3>
	<p>You can have a discussion around the sandbox's content. Just navigate to the comments section in sandbox settings menu.</p>

	<h3>May I break it?</h3>
	<p>We hope you can't. But if you do - please let us know so we can make it safe again.</p>
